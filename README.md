# Google-Homepage
![Website](https://img.shields.io/website?label=demo&up_message=online&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftonyxsun.github.io%2FGoogle-Homepage%2F)

A Google Homepage clone made with HTML and CSS!

### What I've Learnt
* HTML classes and id usage
* code organization and style
* CSS grid & flexbox
* CSS animations and effects
* Developer tools usage

### To Do's
Perhaps in the future, I will come back and improve upon these:
* JS support for pop ups
* Make it functional (make the search field actually lead to Google!)
